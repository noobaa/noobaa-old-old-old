		Envision a ring. It’s full of sand and there are 20 year-old cars warming their engines at its edges. In the center of the ring, there is a screen showing a video: “Optimizing your welcome page”. The narrator is very articulate: “Be simple, clear, and to the point,” he calls, and the cars answer in a roar. “Give the user a clear, actionable flow,” he continues, and some cars shift into gear. Finally, he bellows, “…And more than anything, be focused!” That’s when all hell breaks loose and the cars charge at the screen.

		Whenever I read guides about creating the perfect web page, it all sounds very clear and makes a lot of sense. “Clearly explain the offering and provide a clear actionable item” they say. That is great - assuming you’re developing a website. If you’re developing an application, your welcome page will suck.

		<b>What to Expect? Disappointment!</b>
	</p>
	<p>
		Maybe I’m being a bit harsh. Your welcome page doesn’t suck. Humans suck. We suck since we love expectations.
	</p>
	<p>
		Expectations are the story that we make in our head on how it would all be great. Pessimistic people will tell the story on how it will all be terrible, but as they are pessimistic – that is great, as well. The problem with expectations is that they happen in our head and not in this magical realm you might have heard of – reality.
	</p>
	<p>
		In reality kingdom, things behave a bit differently than in our head, and mostly we expect a bit too much from reality. The gap between our expectation and reality is disappointment.

		<b>Welcome to Hell</b>
	</p>
	<p>
		Welcome pages for applications are awful, as they go about explaining why the application is needed, while adding a lot of bells and whistles to grab the user’s attention. An expectation is bound to be built or the user simply doesn’t click the big red “next” button. If the button is pressed, the expectation was created successfully.
	</p>
	<p>
		The user has the potential of being disappointed by everything: the application is too simple, or too complex, or too plain, or too designed, or too overwhelming, or too “simply not what I expected it to be.”
	</p>
	<p>
		So, you can either aim low, getting users not to sign in as they believe you suck, or you can aim high, get users to sign in and allow reality to do its thing and disappoint them.
	</p>
	<p>
		This is a dead end. Or is it?

		I promise you will be disappointed.
